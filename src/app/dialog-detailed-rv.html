<p>
RV-Across is an simulator which provides interface to associative arithmetic and logical operations via custom instructions in RISC-V environment. It is an union between the Spike simulator and an extension that contains the logic of associative processing. This simulator has the capability to generate performance reports cycle-by-cycle (match, mismatch and memory data).
